<span style="color: red;">I am currently seeking an academic position. Please feel free to reach out if you think there might be a good fit!</span> 

Biography
=
I received my Ph.D. from the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2022. My research focuses on the application of photoacoustic/ultrasound super-resolution imaging technologies and image reconstruction, as well as AI-based image reconstruction methods. I have publicated over 40 papers in international journals and conferences, with more than 1,000 citations on Google Scholar (h-index: 17). I hold 3 national invention patents and have been the grantee for two national scientific grants. As the (co-) first author, I have published 11 SCI journal papers such as Light: Science & Applications, Neural Networks, IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging, Photoacoustics, Biomedical Optics Express, Optics Letters, IEEE Sensors Journal, and IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics. I have also presented over 10 papers at international conferences such as MICCAI, ISBI, IUS, and EMBC.
