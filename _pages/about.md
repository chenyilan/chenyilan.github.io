# <span style="color: red;">I am currently seeking an academic position. Please feel free to reach out if you think there might be a good fit!</span> 

Biography
=
I am previously a Postdoctoral Fellow at Tsinghua Univerisity, where I work with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o9SUWnoAAAAJ&hl" target="_blank">Prof. Jianwen Luo</a >.
I received my Ph.D. from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Mentor:  <a href="http://www.hislab.cn/people" target="_blank">Prof. Fei Gao</a >) in 2022. My research focuses on the application of photoacoustic/ultrasound super-resolution imaging technologies and image reconstruction, as well as AI-based image reconstruction methods. I have publicated over 40 papers in international journals and conferences, with more than 1,000 citations on Google Scholar (h-index: 17). I hold 3 national invention patents and have been the grantee for two national scientific grants. As the (co-) first author, I have published 12 SCI journal papers such as Light: Science & Applications, Neural Networks, IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging, IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control, Photoacoustics, Biomedical Optics Express, Optics Letters, IEEE Sensors Journal, and IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics. I have also presented over 10 papers at international conferences such as MICCAI, ISBI, IUS, and EMBC.
